### Credits
The inspiration for the basic code to stream from flask came from https://github.com/log0/video_streaming_with_flask_example (www.chioka.in). Following are the credits in his readme: Most of the code credits to Miguel Grinberg, except that I made a small tweak. Thanks! http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/video-streaming-with-flask

More code, for the motion detection in the beginning, came from http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/06/01/home-surveillance-and-motion-detection-with-the-raspberry-pi-python-and-opencv/.

Thanks for all the help!
